# QCNN-FH-Classification
The code is the result of a joint Master Thesis between IBM Research Europe and EPFL. The software enables generating the ground-state wave function of the Fermi-Hubbard model as Multiscale Entangled Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), and classifying its phase through QCNN, with a qiskit-based implementation.
